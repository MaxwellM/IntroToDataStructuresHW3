My project contains six Java files that are the work for questions nine and ten from our third homework.

Question#9 has Question9Algorithms and Question9Main Java files. Question9Algorithms Java file has the three algorithm functions that were from our book.I slightly modified them to include a timer so that we can determine their running time. 
Each algorithm is also labeled accordingly.Just run the Question9Main file and read the console output.

Question#10 has CommandParser, Node, RecordManager, and Question10Main Java files. These Java files are the work required for question ten in the homework. 
We were only able to implement the first five functions listed in the homework, (c k), (s k d), (e k), (r k), and (d k). 
The other functions have yet to be correctly implemented. To test the program, execute Question10Main and use the commands in the console when the program is running.
